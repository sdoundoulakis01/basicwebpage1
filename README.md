        <section>
        <p1>Based off the series by Bonnie Bryant, <em>The Saddle Club</em> follows the hectic but adventourous lives of three girls: Stevie, Lisa, and Carole. The girls bond over their love of horses, devotion to each other, and to the stable they ride at. The episodes range from having the girls deal with important and tough topics such as family, school, and even finanicial and romantic problems that happen around them. The other kids they ride with also add an array of character to the show, such as Veronica, the rich, selfish, and clever girl who gets on the trios nerves constantly.</p>
        
 <p2> How <em>The Saddle Club</em> reached every horse girls heart:</p>

<p>While in the books, the girls and the barn they ride at, Pine Hollow Stables, is based in the fictional town of Willow Creek, Virginia. The showrunners however wanted the location and atmopshere of the show to remain neutral. The barn in the show is called Pine Hollow and it is in Willow Creek, but never specified in either Virginia, Canada, or even Australia. The cast consists of Canadians and Australians, making the volume of accents throw off any idea of where the show is taking place. The show creators wanted every girl watching to relate it to their own home and atmospehere and suceeded in doing so.</p>
